The is the document for the flow on how the y axis and y value are adjusted and display
onto the graph with react native chart kit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
file involved: 	Graph.js .src/components/Graph.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1, when the function "changeDataPoint" is called while the linechart component is loading,
the function would first check whether the data is defined before procceding

2, it then make a copy of the "data" containing all the data points.

3, we then define 2 value "bNew" using "Math.min.apply" to find the min value of the array
and the function "GetevenNumberSmaller" to get the value we want to be the min. Similarly done
with "aMax" to find the max value we want to display.

4, we then let "tempDataDatasetsData = dataPoint.datasets[0].data" which is array containing
all the y value of data to be displayed and let "firstData = dataPoint.datasets[0].data[0]" for
the first data of the array which is used later to make the graph beginning smooth like a 
horizontal line and to shift all values to the right in the graph once.

5, we then we define the y value by adding another 2 set of data, one with the max value we want
and the other with the min value we want to set the max and min value of the graph, and also 
added the "firstData" to the beginning of the y value array to shift all data one index foward.

6, we then let "tempLabel = dataPoint.labels" which is the array containing all the x value for
x axis and we redefine the array by "newTempLabel = [null, ...tempLabel]" to also shift the x 
value array one index foward.

7, at last we increment all the change we made to "tempData" which is then returned to the linechart
as the data for the graph to form.

8. Also note that "hidePointsAtIndex={[0]}" is added to have the first data point of both the 
x and y values to be ignored, if not done so the "data" in the array of y values which contain 
the max and min we want would be displayed as clickable point in graph detail screen's graph.
